        <h2>The Escapists</h2>
        <p>This action packed game is a favourite for gamers. If you want to win, you got to have knowledge.You need to plan your escape out of the facility as the prisons get more hi-tech and harder to get out of. It combines modern strategy with retro graphics. Here's what others think about this game. "Impressive effort with a few noticeable problems holding it back. Won't astound everyone, but is worth most people's time and cash" - Destructoid. From my perspective, this game is an 7.5 out of 10 to me. </p>

         <h2>Terraria</h2>
         <p>This indie sandbox game is much more than a 2D version of Minecraft. It is a game with a wide variety of items, people and resources. It can get frustrating at time but it is addicting like hell! "Between building, battling, and exploring, there's an absurd amount of stuff to do. Once you dig into it, you won't want to stop playing" says IGN. I would give it an 9 out of 10. </p>

         <h2>Super Mario Bros New!
	    </h2>
         <p>This is truly one hunk of a game. This reboot of the old Super Mario Bros combines amazing 3D graphics with classic 2D gameplay. There aren't many 2D platformer games that can compete with this epic Nintendo game. Knocking off it's brother and sister, Super Mario Bros and Yoshi's Island, this game is one to be remembered. However, once everything is discovered, it starts to turn into an old vintage. Here's what an expert says - "As pure a game as you could ever wish to play. Adrenaline, frustration, addiction and the largest hunk of retro gaming pleasure that you could purchase. If you own a DS, and you donâ€™t even give this a chance, you might as well get your consoles listed on eBay. Give up. Buy it. Now." -Rewired Mind. I have played this game and is a favourite of mine. I would give it a 9 out of 10.</p>
